# Binary to Decimal and Back Converter
This is a Python implementation for a program that converts from binary to decimal and vice versa. The radix to convert to must be provided as a number (2 or 10). Then, the decimal or binary value to convert needs to be input. If everything goes smoothly, the program displays the equivalent binary or decimal representation.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
